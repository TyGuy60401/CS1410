# Test cases

Four input strings, the same functions are used for
both, so I'm only testing four inputs, and I use the
same function to gather the numbers for the Age, Birth
date, and Birth month so I am testing those all as one,
instead of provided lots of tests for all of the same
function.


| Name    | Age  | Birth date | Birth month | Expected Result                  |
| ----    | ---- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------------                  |
