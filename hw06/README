The only place you should add or edit files is in the /src and /include directories.  Everything else will conflict with updates.

To build and test your code, add your files "hwXX.c" and "hwXX.py" to the src and include directories.  Then (from this directory)

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

This will compile your c code and copy your python code from the src directory.
You can execute your code by typing
./hw01
python hw01.py

You can run the test code by typing
make test
